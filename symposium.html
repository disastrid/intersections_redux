      <h2>About the Symposium</h2>
      <p>Inter/sections culminates in a Symposium on Friday 8 September. This is a day-long event for discussion and exchange between academia, industry and activists. Featuring keynote speakers who are experts in emerging trends in science and media, the Inter/sections Symposium creates a space to debate new ethical frameworks for emerging technologies. The Symposium includes lightning talks from researchers, a hands-on workshop run by the TCCE (The Culture Capital Exchange) exploring ethics, art and technology, as well as a panel on Work Ethics in the Age of Automation. Attendance is free, but booking is essential as lunch will be provided.</p>
      <p>The workshop Technology, Ethics and the Arts Now will be run by Evelyn Wilson. Evelyn Wilson  is Co-Director of The Culture Capital Exchange (www.tcce.co.uk) and specialises in developing and curating both large and small-scale initiatives and activities that bring together researchers with cultural/creative sector practitioners around areas of common concern. She has a long history of working in the media and digital media arts. She is Honorary Research Associate in the Centre for Geo Humanities at Royal Holloway, University of London and a member of the Advisory Group for MAT.</p>

      <p>We continue to welcome applications for lightning talks on ethical issues within your field or participatory activities. Please email info@intersections.io with a short description of your proposed contribution.</p>
